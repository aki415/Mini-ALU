# Mini-ALU
The project involved designing, implementing, and testing various 
components of the ALU, such as the arithmetic logic unit. The Bays3 board provided a suitable 
platform for implementing the ALU, with its FPGA chip and various peripherals. The project required 
a strong understanding of digital circuits and computer architecture, as well as a knowledge in
Verilog.
